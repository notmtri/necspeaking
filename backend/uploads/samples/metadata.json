    "transcript": "My question number is 3 and the prompt is, Cooperative learning is the most effective approach for students to achieve academic success. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? Here is my response. Have you ever felt that your deskmate's explanation to a physics problem is more understandable than that of teachers? Now you may ask, how can a teacher more experienced, more competent than a student, can explain a same problem less effectively than a student, right? Well it's not a you problem, it's actually one of the benefits, one of the upsides of a new system of learning called cooperative learning. And because of this merits and other merits, people are suggesting that this is the most effective system for students to reach peak academic performance. And so in this following speech, I'm going to outline the reasons why this is the best method for studying First of all through cooperative learning students can execute peer review learning This requires no teacher so the burden for these academic tutors are lessened so they can improve the lecture quality, focus on other things that and leave the learning for students to manage. Also, People, students, can now understand problem from the perspective of their peers, which means that from the perspective of teachers, those who are too familiar and too experienced with the problem, Students can now see the problem and understand it and comprehend it through the eyes of students like themselves. So this will foster better comprehension, which will lead them eventually to reaching peak performance after their foundation is affirmed. First of all, and second of all, students can go through another system of learning inside cooperative learning that is also of the same effectiveness that is trial and error Usually when individually practiced trial and error is gone through a few steps First of all students will say do an exercise then he or she will encounter a mistake and therefore after that and after that the student will figure out the mistake and deliver the final solution to that problem to fix the mistake that they made. However, this process can be made a lot more diverse and a lot more effective with peers and cooperative learning. Because, well, while the first and the second steps of doing the exercise and finding the errors are the same, these students can discuss the problem together and eventually more than one solution will be given to the problem. And furthermore, the students in this cooperation can acquire a multifaceted understanding and comprehension of the problem, which will lead them to increase their critical thinking thinking of two sides of the problem always So what my approach on this so what my take on this method of studying Well it useful and I think we should incorporate it into the main curriculum at a lot of universities and academic institutions. However, its effectiveness is limited because if the students, both Both of the students, for example, are not fully versed in the problem. They may drag each other down a rabbit hole if the facts are not checked, if their understandings are incorrect. Because of this, we still need a little bit of teacher's assistance and supervision so so that cooperative learning is kept in check. And we also need blended learning, learning with digitized devices, to fact check keeping the students on the right track. So to conclude, I do believe that cooperative learning is the best way to reaching peak performance in academic institutions because this fosters peer review and trial and error. However, we should also imply blended learning and teacher's assistance to maximize participation.",
    "feedback": "The speech response addresses the topic of cooperative learning and its effectiveness in achieving academic success. The speaker's conclusion is somewhat abrupt and could be more effectively summarized. The speech response demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, but there are some errors in word choice and usage. Pronunciation is generally clear, but there are some issues with intonation and stress patterns. The speech response is generally fluent, but there are some noticeable pauses and hesitations. A more effective introduction could have been used to engage the listener and provide context for the topic.",

    "transcript": "My topic is, in a five-minute speech, answer the following questions: How are you personally impacted by globalization? And how do you expect globalization to impact your future?\r\n\r\nWell, it goes without saying that the world is increasingly becoming a global village thanks to the rapid process of globalization. And this has exerted a profound impact on a great many people all over the world, also including myself. And in my speech, I shall aim to elaborate on the influence of globalization on me, and also to give my predictions on how globalization is going to impact me in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, first and foremost, due to globalization, many changes have happened to my life. And the first influence of globalization would lie in the enhancement of a second language, which is, in my case, English. Indeed, globalization has underlined the necessity of an international means of communication all around the world, and it is, in this case, English. And the fact is that Vietnam has already incorporated English into the educational curriculum as a compulsory subject since the grade three. And many English centers are also established and are also springing up on a national scale in order to teach this new global language to students all over the country. And as a result, I have got a chance to learn this interesting new language, hence gaining access to a wide range of information and knowledge. For instance, I now can read books or materials that are written in English, thus broadening my knowledge and heightening my cultural awareness to a great extent.\r\n\r\nAnother impact of globalization has on me would be the development of an understanding of cultural differences and the importance of acculturation. So, since cultural values of many countries worldwide are being promoted through mainstream media, I can now see the quintessential value, the strength, the weaknesses of each culture, hence learning to appreciate and embracing all cultures worldwide. Besides, as English enabled me to learn how people of Western cultures think and behave, I'm now becoming more receptive and open towards new ideas, and also having a more positive attitude towards people from other cultures. And this absolutely has a positive impact on my long-term development.\r\n\r\nAnd as regards how globalization will influence me in the future, I expect three things to happen. Firstly, I believe that globalization will continue facilitating economic development, especially international commerce in the future. And this would provide me with more opportunities to collaborate with individuals from many countries whose ideas give me a fresh insight into multiple perspectives. In addition, globalization would still be the driving force for cross-cultural interaction. And thanks to this, I expect to have a future with valuable opportunities to get acquaintance with great people from all over the world, and hence, I may gain some new ideas and change something in my behaviors and my attitudes towards many social problems like gender discrimination or racism. And last but not least, I expect to have a better living conditions and living standard in the future with the help of globalization. It is a fact that globalization is boosting the international economic development, and this will continue in the future if it continue at this rate. And my country, Vietnam, will also be positively influenced by this trend. And as a result, I would have a better future with somewhat better living conditions and more access to modern facilities and great infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAnd to sum up, I strongly believe that globalization will continue having a positive impact on my overall development like it is now. And one of the two most influential aspects would be culture and the enhancement of knowledge. Thank you for listening.",
    "feedback": "The high quality of the speech stems primarily from its effective technical execution and structural rigor. The speaker utilizes strong signposting—employing phrases like \"First and foremost,\" \"Another impact,\" \"As regards how globalization will influence me,\" and \"To sum up\"—to create a clear, logical progression that is easy for the listener to follow. This structural technique ensures that the argument directly addresses and precisely aligns with the two-part prompt (past impact and future expectation). Furthermore, the speech is elevated by the use of sophisticated, academic vocabulary (\"profound impact,\" \"aculturation,\" \"quintessential value,\" \"facilitating\") and the skillful incorporation of specific, relevant examples (English being a compulsory subject since Grade 3 in Vietnam, and discussing social issues like gender discrimination), which transforms abstract claims into credible, persuasive evidence. These techniques collectively demonstrate a high command of both language and argumentative structure, contributing significantly to a top score."

    "transcript": "My question is, some people believe that developments in the field of AI will have a positive impact on our lives in the near future. Others, by contrast, are worried that we are not prepared for a future in which computers are more intelligent than humans. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Here is my response. For long, we have always associated consciousness with flesh and blood. But only biological animals could ever have consciousness, and so we often term things such as the rock, or the wall, or say the tree as unconscious. But we've always had a question in our minds. What if consciousness could be replicated using silicon, or in other words, computers? For many years, it was a dream, and this dream materialized in two ways. I remember growing up with the film series of The Terminator, where an artificial intelligence network named Skynet took over control of the US Department of Defense and nuked the entire world after it was given executive command of the network. And of course on the other end of the spectrum we have Wall a tea animation about a robot which is altruistic and simply wants a ham and a dance And so, these two films demonstrate the two opposite spectrums of humanity's responses to AI. And similarly, people are reacting to the recent development of AI in two ways. One is that it will be beneficial to our future, and two, that humans are simply not ready to be dethroned as the most intelligent species on this planet. And so today I will give a talk on the topic and discuss both of these views and my opinion is that it really depends on what we do regarding AI. And so regarding the beneficial side of AI for our future, I will analyze it from two aspects, educationally and economically. From the perspective of education, AI can prove to increase educational quality. From the perspective of the student, having AI assistance, for example, may help these students have a personalized education that caters to their own strengths and weaknesses. And the constant help that is offered by AI assists these students on their way to study which increases the quality of education that they receive and also for the side of the teachers because AI is extremely adept at processing raw data all the boring administrative tasks that teachers have to do to maintain the running the operation of schools could then be delegated to that to AI and so So this would free up essential time for teachers to communicate, to interact and to teach students. And these effects combined will increase the educational quality in general. And speaking from an economic standpoint is that, as I mentioned earlier, AI is extremely adept at processing raw data. So what does it mean economically? that it can analyze market trends, it can gather a lot of raw data and perform inter and perform extrapolation to predict future economic trends and so for bankers and for people working in the financial sector in general AI is a godsend because it can help them predict trends and to increase their resilience against potential recessions that may be on maybe in the pipeline but But some people say that we are simply not ready for future with AI as the smartest And I think that there are two main reasons for this apprehension. The first is AI-related job loss. What I mean by that is that as AI surpasses humans and intelligence, every single line of work, even the ones that are most intellectually demanding such as teachers, doctors, and say a very famous example of IT workers will be slowly replaced. And as these people get pushed out of their positions, it will lead to adverse economic impacts and social upheaval as the rate of unemployment now increases, skyrocket. And there's also the existential crisis of AI revolting against humanity and gaining consciousness. And some people fear that in the future we may see that we humans are enslaved by hyperfast computational robots, which is not a pleasant future. In fact, it's a dystopian. And so in conclusion, I think that AI can bring benefits educationally and economically, but it can also cause job loss and existential crisis. So it is imperative that we analyze our decisions to AI carefully.",
    "feedback": "The speech achieves a high score through masterful use of structural and rhetorical techniques. The speaker starts with an engaging philosophical hook about consciousness and immediately grounds the debate using clear pop culture analogies (Terminator vs. Wall-E). The argument is rigorously structured, employing effective signposting (\"And so regarding the beneficial side,\" \"The first is AI-related job loss\") to logically divide the analysis into distinct economic, educational, and existential components. Crucially, the speaker adds nuance by examining educational benefits from both student and teacher perspectives, and uses sophisticated vocabulary (\"extrapolation,\" \"apprehension,\" \"dystopian\") to elevate the discussion. This organization ensures the complex prompt is fully addressed while the conditional, mature thesis provides a strong, balanced conclusion, making the argument highly compelling and easy to follow."
